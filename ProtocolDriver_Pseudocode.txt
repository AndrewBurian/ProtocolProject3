		If ENQ Rx'd
			Call RxProc
		Else if Output Available
			Call TxProc

RxProc
------------------
Tx ACK1
While True
	Wait for Data, Bad Data or EOT to be Rx'd or the program to end
	If Rx EOT or connection timed out
		Return to Idle
	Else If Rx Data
		Tx ACK2
	Else If Rx Bad Data
		Tx NAK

TxProc
------------------
Tx ENQ
	While there's data to send, the sending limit isn't reached, and retransmit hasn't failed
		Create Packet
		Tx Packet
		If response times out
			While Retransmission Attempts <= 5
				Attempt to Retransmit Packet
