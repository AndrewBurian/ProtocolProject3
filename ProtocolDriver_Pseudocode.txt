While the Program isn't done
	Check if there's output from incomplete previous transfer
		If there is, set Output Available event to signaled state
	Wait for either ENQ Rx'd or Output Available event
		If ENQ Rx'd
			Call RxProc
		Else if Output Available
			Call TxProc

RxProc
------------------
Tx ACK1
While True
	Wait for Data, Bad Data or EOT to be Rx'd or the program to end
	If Rx EOT or connection timed out
		Return to Idle
	Else If Rx Data
		Tx ACK2
	Else If Rx Bad Data
		Tx NAK

TxProc
------------------
Tx ENQ
	While there's data to send, the sending limit isn't reached, and retransmit hasn't failed
	Wait for End of Program, an ACK to be received, a NAK to be received, or an ENQ to be received
	If an ACK was received
		Send next packet
	Else If Response times out or NAK was received
		If the last packet sent was the ENQ
			Return to ProcotolControlThread
		Else
			Attempt to retransmit 5 times
			If more than 5 Retransmission Attempts
				Retransmit failed; exit loop
	Else If an ENQ was received
		Sleep for a random period
	If Retransmit Failed
		Return to Idle
	Else
		Tx EOT
